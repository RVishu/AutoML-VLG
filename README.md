# README for Hyperparameter Optimization using Gradient Boosting Classifier

This repository contains code and documentation for optimizing the hyperparameters of a Gradient Boosting Classifier using three different techniques: Randomized Search CV, Hyperopt, and Bayesian Optimization. The dataset used for this demonstration is `diabetes.csv`.

## Introduction

Hyperparameter optimization significantly enhances the fine-tuning of machine learning models. Hyperparameters are adjustable settings that control the model's learning from data and are fixed before training begins. Effective hyperparameter tuning can greatly improve a model's performance. This document focuses on comparing Randomized Search CV, Hyperopt, and Bayesian Optimization techniques for hyperparameter refinement and their impact on model performance.

## Hyperparameters

- **Definition:** Hyperparameters are configuration settings used to tune the training process of machine learning models.
- **Distinction from Model Parameters:** Unlike model parameters learned during training, hyperparameters are set before training begins.
- **Function:** Hyperparameters guide the training algorithm.
- **Influence:** They significantly affect the model's performance, learning speed, and generalization ability.
- **Examples:** Learning rate, number of estimators, minimum samples per leaf, and maximum features.

## Why Use Gradient Boosting Classifier?

- **Supervised Learning Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting Classifier is a powerful ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees and combines their results to improve accuracy.
- **Versatile and Scalable:** Effective for handling large and complex datasets, suitable for high-dimensional feature spaces.
- **Feature Importance Insights:** Provides valuable insights into the significance of different features in the dataset.
- **High Predictive Accuracy:** Known for high predictive accuracy while minimizing the risk of overfitting.
- **Broad Applicability:** Robust and reliable, making it a popular choice in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and image analysis.

## Key Hyperparameters for Optimization

- **n_estimators:**
  - Controls the number of boosting stages.
  - Higher values generally improve accuracy but increase computational complexity.
  - Optimal number balances performance and training time.
- **learning_rate:**
  - Shrinks the contribution of each tree.
  - Smaller values make the model more robust to overfitting but require more trees.
- **min_samples_leaf:**
  - Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
  - Higher values create simpler, more generalized trees.
- **max_features:**
  - Number of features to consider when looking for the best split.
  - Options include 'sqrt', 'log2', or a specific number.

## Optimization Techniques

### Randomized Search CV

- **Purpose:** Randomly samples hyperparameter combinations to find the best set.
- **Process:**
  - Define a distribution for each hyperparameter.
  - Randomly sample a set number of combinations.
  - Evaluate each combination using cross-validation.
  - Select the combination with the best cross-validation score.

### Hyperopt

- **Purpose:** Uses the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) for optimization.
- **Process:**
  - Define a search space for hyperparameters.
  - Use TPE to model the search space and guide the search for optimal hyperparameters.
  - Evaluate hyperparameter sets using cross-validation and update the model iteratively.
  - Return the best hyperparameter set based on evaluation metrics.

### Bayesian Optimization

- **Purpose:** Iterative method to minimize or maximize an objective function efficiently.
- **Process:**
  - Start with a small, randomly selected set of hyperparameters.
  - Construct a probabilistic model (e.g., Gaussian Process) based on initial evaluations.
  - Use an acquisition function to select the next set of hyperparameters.
  - Evaluate the objective function with selected hyperparameters.
  - Update the model with new evaluation data and iterate until a stopping criterion is met.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Load Dataset

- Load the `diabetes.csv` dataset.
- Split the dataset into features (`X`) and target (`y`).

### Step 2: Preprocess Data

- Identify numeric and categorical features.
- Define preprocessing pipelines for both feature types.

### Step 3: Define Model and Evaluation Function

- Create a function to build a pipeline with the preprocessor and classifier.
- Define an evaluation function to compute the ROC AUC score.

### Step 4: Randomized Search CV

- Define parameter distributions for `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- Execute the search and retrieve the best model and results.

### Step 5: Hyperopt Optimization

- Define the search space for hyperparameters.
- Implement the objective function for Hyperopt.
- Execute the search and retrieve the best model and trials.

### Step 6: Bayesian Optimization

- Define the function for Bayesian Optimization.
- Implement the Bayesian Optimization process.
- Execute the search and retrieve the best model and results.

### Step 7: Evaluate Models

- Evaluate each optimized model on the test set using the ROC AUC score.

### Step 8: Visualization

- Plot the performance of each optimization method.
- Compare cross-validation scores and ROC AUC scores for the test set.

## Results

- The ROC AUC scores for each optimization technique are compared and presented.
- Performance metrics and visualizations provide insights into the effectiveness of each method.

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates the application of Randomized Search CV, Hyperopt, and Bayesian Optimization for tuning hyperparameters of a Gradient Boosting Classifier. By comparing these techniques, we can identify the most effective method for a given problem, enhancing model performance and reliability.
